I can wear them for hours without the slightest discomfort, and they are also incredibly light, I barely feel them sitting on my head (which is really nice considering I'm recovering from a whiplash neck injury).

Anytime the cord gets caught on something, it snaps away and you just plug it back in and keep going.  Update: I've had these for going on (3) years, now. These are the most amazing headphones EVER!! I cannot tell you how many times, while getting in my car with these around my neck,  that I've arrived at my destination and realized I slammed the cord in the car door. Every time a feeling of dread comes over me, just knowing that I've ruined the cord by slamming it in the car door.

I would definitely recommend these over beats 10/10 times and recommend them to any audio lover 10/10 times.<br /><br />So, the length, I received these headphones as my birthday gift when I was 16, and have had them for two and a half years... no complaints whatsoever. I've had the opportunity to try Beats and other competitors products and they just don't compare to the AE2's. I got to pick this present out, and even as a gift from a fairly affluent family, I chose these as apposed to the noise cancellation headphones just because even if its my parents money, I always love to save money. The fact of the matter is, if you have the volume on halfway or higher with these things on... you will not hear anything outside. these are tremendous headphones and if I had to be a picky little bitch about them, I'd say there's not enough foam padding for the headband portion of the product.<br />Im no audio junkie by any means, I travel with my parents a lot and am a woodworker and these serve as my casual and woodworking headphones and I love them.",

            "Review__c": "These are great headphones at any price. But, value-for-your-dollar, they're probably the best out there. They have a deep, rich, true sound. They're very light and the pressure on your head is also very light. Just enough for effective passive noise reduction.<br /><br />I also have a pair of Acme QC15 headphones, but I use the AE2s much more frequently for a few reasons. First, this pair is noticeably lighter than the more expensive ones. Partially because the active noise canceling in the QC15s requires a battery. It's only a small AAA battery, but it still adds a bit of weight that you just don't have with these AE2s. So, if there's no ambient noise (i.e. you're at home in a quiet house), then these AE2 headphones sound as good as the much more expensive noise-canceling models. There's no &#34;On-Off&#34; switch with these AE2s, so you're not putting them on only to find a dead battery because you left the switch on. Just plug & play.<br /><br />One thing that I don't care for is the swiveling ear cups. I know it's a personal taste thing and that people who travel with them might find that to be a great feature. But I find it annoying having to un-swivel them out every time I put them on. A minor complaint, but it's the only one I have. My QC15s do the same thing. Just a personal irritation for me.<br /><br />I highly recommend these. If you're giving them as a gift, they will not be disappointed with the quality or performance of these headphones. I suppose some kids would like some crazy colors or blingy look, but I like that these headphones are just matte black & silver. All business, no show.",

I listen on spotify (I am a paying subscriber -- I don't know if the sound quality differs for free vs paid but just stating that for the record).<br /><br />These earphones are my first real investment into a better set. I picked this model because it fit my ears quite comfortably compared to the ATH-M50s. I can wear these all day indoors sitting at my computer and not feel any heat build up around my ears. The materials on this headset are plastic but this also helps keep the weight down and also adds to comfort factor. The ear cushions are so good that when I tried out the ATH-M50 on my head it felt really heavy and the ear cushions on the M50 were awful. They felt like a very cheap plastic with barely any cushion or plush feel.<br /><br />After 7 months of use of the Acme AE2 (and purchasing the Fiio E11k portable amp)  I found the ATH-M50 sound quality far superior than the Acme AE2. The drivers in the ATH-M50 are really good and you can crank up the volume all you want the sound composition (its integrity) stays consistent. The sound becomes louder but still so crisp and clear. The Acme AE2 just feel so much more flat compared to the ATH-M50 and don't offer the same sound quality. The sound rendition on the Acme ae2 feels very feeble and cheap. Some days i wonder if they bothered putting any decent technology in the AE2.<br /><br />I'm now looking to the ATH-M50x for my next upgrade because the ear cushions are supposedly more comfortable. I just like the sound rendition on the ATH-M50 better thats all. But in terms of weight and comfort the Acme ae2 are great. I even took them on an airplane and without even playing anything they make travelling in economy class an experience that is easier on your ears. You can cut out background chatter and baby noises. So I will keep this headset as a backup or spare.",

I threw 'em out when I should've just had them repaired...<br /><br />My Creative Zen Touch (it's 10 years old now, and still works, google it, lol) blew the speakers when I let a buddy try them on and cranked some Eazy-E to the max.  The bass blew 'em out.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br /><br />At the time, I had no experience with high-end speakers/headphones but I remember them sounding &#34;pretty&#34; good.

I have only had these for a year and while the headband and earcups have no wear the actual headphones are failing. The left ear is noticeably quieter than the right and no amount of balancing via windows options seem to make a difference.

            "Review__c": "Just to start off, I'm not here to bash on Acme at all. I love them. I just know that this product isn't as good as other Acme products.<br /><br />The headphone feels light and one may even consider call it flimsy, but the build construction is solid and earcups fold flat for easier portability. We may all wish that it folded up all the way, but good enough. Inside the earcups, it's hollow and there's a sense of... &#34;hm something's not right.&#34; However, those thoughts disappear when you put it on your head. The cushions on the earcups and on top of the band are extremely comfortable and I've found it to be comfortable wearing it for many hours even with my glasses. Out of so many headphones I've tried, this is one of the most comfortable over the ear headphones and I'd definitely recommend for a long hours of work or even to keep your ears warm on a cold day in place of earmuffs!<br /><br />Sound is decent. I'm no audiophile and won't be doing any scientific tests, but I could tell you that the sound I hear is not bad, while not amazing. Because of my expectation that comes with the amazing sound I hear on Acme IE2, it doesn't quite meet it at all. That doesn't mean it's bad either however, just not as good as Acme's other products.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's a good set of headphones. The lightweight construction and soft paddings allow comfortable and long lasting usage, and wire only dangles from one side of the headphones so that it won't get in your way when you're eating or something. If you'd like, you can upgrade this set to a Acme AE2i by replacing the cable with a AE2 inline remote and microphone cable as easily as unplugging the original and plugging the new one back in. +1 for having that option even though that wire with remote and mic is a bit pricy. One may also wish it came with a sturdy case to protect the headphones like the ones that come with Acme QuietComfort 15. The drawstring one that comes with AE2 will protect from scratches and blemishes from physical contact, but it won't stop a heavy object possibly crushing it in a bag.<br /><br />In overall, if you're looking for a comfortable set of headphones that will last you a long time, go for it. But if you're more of a bass person or an audiophile, maybe not. Its comfortable paddings, long and thin cable all add up to a very lightweight and portable headphones that will be pleasant to wear. I wish they had made it a bit more premium like the Acme logo that could've been something better than printed label that may fade over time, and inside of the earcups that don't look like a high-end set. It does some noise reduction simply because it covers up both ears, but it's no QC15 or Harman Kardon's NC. I'd personally go for Acme IE2 instead since a cheaper product is able to produce better sound in my opinion, but AE2 is surely so comfortable that you need to try it on yourself to believe it.<br /><br />Check out the full review on Normal Consumer.

Of course just like any good review this will be unbiased with considerable cons. Every small paragraph will consist of different parts of the headphones.

            "Review__c": "I have owned these for about 3.5 years now, here is a brief overview of my experience:<br /><br />You can probably get better headphones for the money, Acme pays a lot for marketing and you're paying a little bit for that. But, when I bought these, $150 was a lot to me. I wanted to try the headphones first before I bought them, and there was no way for me to try out other brands at local stores so I ended up going with these.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sound is good. I honestly don't have a benchmark, but it was leagues above anything I had heard before.<br />-Very comfortable. Not just saying that. Thousands of hours of wearing these and I never once though &#34;this is uncomfortable.&#34;<br />-Padding doubles as earmuffs in cold weather (not even kidding, this has been very useful for me...)<br />-While these are not noise cancelling headphones, the padding dampens out certain background frequencies ver well<br />-One time I snapped the cable by accident (it is detachable, so you won't wreck the headphones in this situation), and was pleased to learn a new cable is only $7. They don't try and stiff you on the cost of parts.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-About 3 years into ownership, the sound started to get fuzzy unless I adjust the (detachable) cable to just the right position. I imagine it will completely die soon, it's been getting worse.<br />-All of the padding is very faded and the Acme logo rubbed off<br /><br />Considering how long I've had these, I wouldn't even consider these cons too big of a deal. I've easily listened to thousands of hours of music on these things.<br /><br />While I am happy with my AE2s, I will never buy Acme headphones again. Their new Soundtrue headphones are the same exact thing soundwise (stated by a Acme rep), but they are more expensive and the only thing they have changed is the color. That kind of marketing is ridiculous and pathetic. 4 years of the AE2s being out and all they could do was change the color? Either buy the &#34;old&#34;AE2s for less, or take your money elsewhere.",

Tried various styles of buds, on-ear, and over-the-ear models. Had my eye on these headphones for awhile, and on Amazon Black Friday scored the best deal I've ever seen. Including at a big box club store. I jumped on an early Christmas present for myself and glad I did. Wow. These are the most comfortable and best quality headphones I've ever owned, and the sound quality can't be beat IMO. Sony's aren't bad, but with the Acme I hear so much more range and clarity it's like my music is all new. I think I paid  $80 for them...they're worth twice that in terms of sound quality.

These sound so good, music is rich and full. Bass is deep without sounding overdone, mid and high ranges are great. Full sound, it feels like I'm right there in the room. They are very comfortable too, I wore them for 3 hours straight and didn't mind at all. They are NOT noise cancelling but because of their good sound and superb fit they do filter out a bit of outside noise.

The reviews were overwhelmingly positive so I bought them.<br /><br />They are great.<br />- Light<br />- Comfortable for extended wear<br />- Good sound quality, even to my defective ears<br />- Probably not such a big deal for people with normal hearing, but excellent stereo effect<br /><br />I obviously can't speak to the ultimate audiophile quality of these phones, but they probably aren't fancy enough for golden ears anyway.<br /><br />I would unhesitatingly recommend them to a friend.",

Within the last 3 months, the cushion around the ears started to come apart. Considering how old they were, I figured I'd replace them with new ones. They were definitely worth the original cost, considering how many hours of use I've had with them. Even now, I could have purchased replacement cushions, but decided a new pair would be best.",

To hear the depth of sounds, the volume must be turned up to the middle or high.  Bass is subtle and okay.  I prefer my seinhauser headphones.<br /><br />Build:<br /><br />The build quality of these headphones is okay.  They are built well, but are made of all plastic.  The earcups are made of leatherette and are very comfortable when they have cushion.  You may need to replace them at some point.  The plastic does get scratched easily and the Acme logo is painted on and can be easily be &#34;rubbed&#34; off.<br /><br />Overall, there are much better headphones that offer a lot more at this price or cheaper.",
