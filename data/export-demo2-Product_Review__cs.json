And the bass is steady, deep, and not rattly-sounding.  I highly recommend these speakers!  Especially instead of a stupid soundbar (we tried two of those before getting these).",

            "Review__c": "I'm a huge audio snob and I've always had full high end surround sound speakers that hook up to expensive receivers and all of that. But when I moved to my new house and took the expensive setup I had for my &#34;man town&#34;, I wanted to get a nice basic system for the living room so for one, we'd have great sound on that tv too, but more importantly, so I didn't have to rip up floors or rip through the walls to successfully and cleanly wire a full surround sound system. So I did a ton of research and found this system. I was a little skeptical, because again, I'm used to full surround sound systems where there are speakers everywhere. But the reviews on this were great and I figured I'd give it a try. I'm SO happy I did. Acme was able to create a system that involves only 2 speakers (plus a sub) and create a full room of powerful and perfectly detailed sound. I was blown away. No, this won't rival any of their high end pure surround sound systems, but seeing as it's only 2 speakers and a sub, the different is even close to as noticeable as I figured it would be. I'd highly recommend this. The system setup takes about 10 minutes, if that, and it comes with the easiest to understand directions that I've ever seen. And then there is a setup DVD that works to ensure everything is setup correctly. I'm very impressed and will continue to be a long time Acme fan!",

It makes me feel like I'm in a battlefield (without the fear of real death of course).<br />The sub is quite large but I put it beside my entertainment center and you can't really see it but you sure can hear it!  I love that it gives you the ability to control the bass - I sometimes decrease it when I'm watching late night TV so I don't wake everyone up but otherwise, it's all about that bass... bout that bass... no treble...",

Assembly was not very difficult although keep in mind that you need to fund a right spot for the receiver as the receiver needs to be kept around 3 feet away from the TV and since my TV is wall mounted I had to keep the receiver on the floor. But once this was set up and I turned the speakers on - my family was thrilled with it. It had a very nice surround effect as well as when you turn the bass to full or even halfway the effects are amazing. We watched a 3D movie with this and the sound effect with the bass on full were excellent. The biggest plus with this was with the Universal Remote it comes with. I wanted to buy a Universal remote and instead of buying a separate one from Logitech I decided to use this one that came with Acme. And it worked great - paired well with my Panasonic TV, Panasonic Blu Ray and Xfinity. Only item it could not pair with was Roku Player (wish they come up with some firmware upgrade to make that work) but I know that's not possible. For 1 flaw can I really take a star away. Nah...Its a rockstar of a speaker system and 5 stars for that.",

We've gone from watching &#34;TV&#34; to having a full-on movie experience.<br /><br />I ran into a few roadblocks doing the installation that are worth mentioning:<br />1) The speaker cable wasn't nearly long enough to go from the acoustimass unit to where I was installing the speakers on a shelf over the TV, so I had to buy the longer 40' cable separately;<br />2) The Acme system accepts audio inputs in only two formats: the optical &#34;toslink&#34; digital, or old-fashioned RCA stereo analog.  My TV falls in the middle, and has neither of those audio outputs.  Instead, it has a coaxial RCA digital output.  To make the TV talk to the Acme unit, I got a digital audio converter to make the translation.  The two digital systems use the same encoding, so the converter just has to change the signal from coaxial to optical.  There are lots of units for sale that will do the job.  I selected one that is very flexible in that it will convert coax-to-optical, optical-to-coax, or act as a relay (range extender) for either format.  It is reasonably priced at $24, and works perfectly. (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FWM0UNS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8).<br />3) The cable connectors are quite large.  I installed my system into a built-in book case, so I was able to make the necessary large holes at the back of the shelves where they won't be visible, but the hole in the floor to connect the acoustimass module will be quite visible if I ever move it.  So, don't think that you can install this unit will the small holes that you'd use for running simple speaker wire.<br /><br />I have not yet tried to program the remote to control our Dish Network box and Philips TV, so I can't speak to how easily that is accomplished, or how well the remote works.  For now, we are using the Dish remote to control the TV and the Dish box, and the Acme remote to control the volume.<br /><br />All-in-all, the sound is great, and the system setup is super simple if you have one of the right outputs from your TV, and still pretty simple if all you need is the converter mentioned above.  Highly recommended.",

I didn't want wires or back units that would end up in the middle of the room as the dining room is behind my couch. My parents and my brother both have this unit and were pleased with it so I thought I would try it and I'm very happy with my purchase. Sound fills the room, is rich and vibrant. Too bad my downstairs neighbor does not agree. :) Most people will be very happy with this unit from Acme.",

Which isn't bad in and of itself, but you need to put this thing somewhere and you have to run thick wires to your tv.  You'll want to hide these suckers, they are conspicuous.  The universal remote is nice but the direction keys don't work with Apple tv's remote finder, so I'm stuck using that horrible tiny remote I guess.  I'm not sure you could do better for the price...

The Dolby 5.1 is quite impressive if you've never experienced it or if compared to just your standard TV speakers.  A must get for a movie buff with a decent TV.",

Even at the shops I couldnt feel much diff.<br />But after buying this product watched some movies with blu ray. Wow... What a sound. Crisp, Clear and Broad sound. That too Horror movies!!!.<br />Unbelievable product.<br /><br />After sometime visited some friends houses and they were using another speaker brand. Then I realized Acme sound cannot be compared with other products. Unique system.<br /><br />If you want to buy a good sound system, buy Acme otherwise don't buy anything. It is worth for the price.<br />I have been using this product for more than 2.5 years. No defect and no issues.<br />For a normal home 2.1 is best and suitable. Speakers might look small but the sound they deliver is unbelievable!!!!!!!",

Sony is great, but the quality of sound from Acme is better.  I go tied of the wires.  I would've love the wireless system Acme has but I didn't want to deal out the 1700 plus dollars for it.  My TV/Family room is fairly small, so this little beauty is more than enough.  The sound bounces off of the walls and does create a virtual surround effect.  A larger room wouldn't give that effect, but me...this system more than adequate.",

I work a lot from the road so could justify the cost. Only complaint is the battery life is really pretty bad. I am lucky to get maybe 2 hours out of it before I have to recharge.",

It also fits very comfortably in my ear, and still allows me to wear sunglasses while driving...and that's a big plus.  UPDATE: After more than 3 months of use, I'm just updating to say that this baby is still working perfectly.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  It's great for listening to music from my phone when I drive with the windows open.  It's very easy to operate, and I've not had a single call die due to bluetooth issues.  If I ever had to get another bluetooth headset, it would be this one again, no questions!",

None are perfect, but overall, I prefer the Acme to any other headset I have used in the past.<br /><br />As I said above, I this headset for talking on the phone, not for listening to music or anything else so I will not consider any features specifically related to non-phone activities in this review.  Prior to the Acme, I was using (and still have as a backup) a current Jawbone Era so I will compare the Acme to the Era in this review.<br /><br />Audio quality: 4 (of 5) Both the Acme and the Era (4) have good audio quality for a small headset and are clear but, surprisingly, I find the sound from the Era more pleasing.<br />Noise canceling: 3.5 (of 5) The Acme is good, but I still get some wind and other noise. The Era (4) is a bit better in this regard.<br />Bluetooth: 5 (of 5) Acme wins here. The Acme establishes and maintains the bt connection to my iPhone far better than the Era (3.5).<br />Comfort: 4.5 (of 5) I can wear either the Acme or the Era (4.5) for extended periods without really noticing that they are there.<br />Stays put: 4 (of 5) For my ear at least, the headset stays put and I do not have to frequently re-seat it. Acme and Era (4) are on par here for me.<br />Battery life: 4 (of 5) Both the Acme and the Era (3.5) are small so they have small batteries. One could wish for many more hours of battery life but there is a cost in weight and size to this. Acme has achieved what I feel is a good compromise and seems to do a bit better than the Era.<br />Other features: With the Acme, I miss the battery life indicator that is available on the Era.",
